Feature: Verify ADR repo state before accepting/rejecting proposed ADR

    Background:
        Given a new working directory

    Scenario: Fail when no existing numbered ADR in repository
        Given an empty file named "docs/adr/XXXX-an-adr.md"
        When I run "pyadr approve"
        Then it should fail with
            """
            There should be at least one initial reviewed ADR (usually './docs/adr/0000-record-architecture-decisions.md').
            """

    Scenario: Fail when there is no proposed ADR in repository
        Given an empty file named "docs/adr/0000-record-architecture-decisions.md"
        When I run "pyadr approve"
        Then it should fail with
            """
            There is no ADR to approve/reject (should be of format './docs/adr/XXXX-adr-title.md')

    Scenario: Fail when too many proposed ADR in repository

        And an empty file named "docs/adr/XXXX-a-second-adr.md"
