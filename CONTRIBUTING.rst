Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up ``pyadr`` for local development on a Mac.

Prerequisite
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 with `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_

* `poetry <https://poetry.eustace.io/>`_

* `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ (optional but useful)

Setup (for Mac)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Fork the ``pyadr`` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/pyadr.git

3. Assuming you have the prerequisites installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ cd pyadr/
    $ make setup-dev-env-full

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass typing, linting, formatting, unit tests
   (for all versions of Python) and functional (bdd) tests::

    $ flake8 pyadr tests
    $ python setup.py test or pytest
    $ tox

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.
